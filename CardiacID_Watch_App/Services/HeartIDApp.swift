//  DELETED FILE - HeartIDApp.swift
//  HeartID Watch App
//
//  This file was completely disabled and contained duplicate @main declarations.
//  The active app entry point is in HeartIDWatchApp.swift.
//  
//  File deleted as part of architecture cleanup to resolve:
//  - Type conflicts and ambiguous declarations
//  - Duplicate @main entry points
//  - Disabled code wrapped in #if false blocks
//
//  Architectural improvements implemented:
//  ✅ Single Entry Point: HeartIDWatchApp.swift is the sole @main
//  ✅ Service-Oriented Architecture: Clean dependency injection
//  ✅ SwiftUI Implementation: Modern declarative UI patterns
//  ✅ Environment Object Pattern: Consistent service management
